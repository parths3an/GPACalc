# GPACalc_v1.0
This is a simple version of the big project GPACalc. This version represents the logic of the calculation behind basic GPA calculation.
This subproject will allow you to enter the class information and calculate your GPA and allow you to print it as well.

Reason to make the subprogram:
To test the logic of the GPA Calcultion. 
To save Classes information in a vector outside of the class. 
To perform deferent test on the data and input so that way we don't have to crash the main 
project. GPA_Calc.
